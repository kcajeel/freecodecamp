# freeCodeCamp Projects

This repository stores the projects I developed while doing the Responsive Web Design curriculum on [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org).

Most of my classes go over programming and computer science concepts, so a lot of my projects thusfar have little in the way of user interfaces. I want to be able to write software that non-technical people can use, so I'm learning web design on my own to do that.

I like that freeCodeCamp starts from the basics and builds up from there. My favorite websites have always been simple HTML/CSS/JS sites that load fast without complex frameworks or libraries involved, and that is the kind of website I would like to create should I make one. 

After completing the curriculum, I might branch off and learn React or Svelte or Angular or Next.js, but I might not think that they're necessary to build what I want to build. We'll see. I would like to use my frontend knowledge to make better UI's for native applications using something like [Tauri](https://tauri.app) though.
