      <h2 id="about">About Miso</h2>
      <p>Mr. Miso was discovered by a tag-and-release (TNR) group with a litter of other kittens outside of a sushi restaurant. He was named Miso because of his color, and all of the kittens in his litter were given sushi-themed names (Tobiko, Sake, Wasabi, etc).</p>
      <p>The TNR group that rescued Miso neutered and immunized him along with the other kittens. It is customary for TNR groups to clip the ears of cats they take in to avoid catching the same cat twice, and this is why Miso's left ear is clipped at the end. </p>
      <p>Because the kittens were so young (~6 months old), the TNR group believed that they could be domesticated and adopted by people. So, they listed the litter of kittens on Petfinder. Luckily for Miso, Mai and Jack were looking for a pet cat and they found him. They went to the TNR office to meet the kittens and chose Miso because of his distinctive markings and playful nature. </p>
      <p>Nowadays, Miso enjoys a leisurely life at Jack and Mai's apartment. He has his own cat tree to sleep on, and he is fed throughout the day. They let him out on the porch to be outside when he wants, and they give him lots of pets. Miso is spoiled with too many toys to count. Still a playful kitten at heart, he loves swatting at lures and toy mice that have been littered around the apartment. Miso is truly a happy kitty!</p>
